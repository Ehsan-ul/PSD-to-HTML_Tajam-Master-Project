Live Website: https://ehsan-ul.github.io/PSD-to-HTML_Tajam-Master-Project/
<p>I design a PSD formatted Company Website with HTML and CSS. There I used bootstrap4, slick slider, fontawesome, lightbox, venobox to decorate it. I also used jquery, typeJS, smooth-scrolling and scrollspy to make it more gorgeous and lively.</p>
